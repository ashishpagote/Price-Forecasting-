Introduction of Data:
The market price of a product can change for many reasons. The relation of market supply and customer demand influences the price of a product most. Also, there are many other reasons, such as technology innovation, society stability or customer preference, can also affect the price of goods.
In this project, we find a dataset from Kaggle that contains the daily price of twenty-three different commodities from the year 2000 to the current year. These commodities vary from 6 categories, and they are energy, industrial metals, precious metals, grains, livestock and softs. All prices are quoted in Euros per unit weight.
